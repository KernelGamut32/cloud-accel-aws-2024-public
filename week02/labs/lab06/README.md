# Lab 06 - [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/tutorial.html)

**NOTE: Use an A Cloud Guru (ACG) AWS Playground for this lab**

**If you encounter "no space left on device issues", use https://ryansouthgate.com/aws-cloud9-no-space-left-on-device/#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20a%20few%20things%20we%20can%20tackle%20here%2C,clean%20up%20that%20much%20free%20space%20for%20me**

1. In the lab environment, create a new Cloud9 environment using the following steps:
    - Open `CloudShell` (in the upper right)
    - Clone this repository to `CloudShell` using `git clone https://github.com/KernelGamut32/cloud-accel-aws-2024-public.git`
    - Navigate to the root folder using `cd cloud-accel-aws-2024-public`
    - Execute the bash script to create a new Cloud9 environment using `./cloud9.sh '<env-name>' 't3.medium' 'amazonlinux-2023-x86_64' <sleep-time>` (replace `<env-name>` with your environment name and `<sleep-time>` with the targeted delay)
    - Close `CloudShell`
    - In the search bar, search for `Cloud9` (open in a new tab)
    - Click the radio button next to your environment and click `Open in Cloud9`
    - Execute the remaining instructions in the Cloud9 environment
1. Follow the steps outlined in the linked tutorial
1. Use the steps described in lab 05 to create an SSH key (or reuse the key created as part of a previous lab)
1. For `docusaurus.config.js`, use something like `https://<user/org ID>.gitlab.io` for `url` and leave `baseUrl` at `/`
1. Once build/deploy steps complete, use `https://<user/org ID>.gitlab.io/<project name>` to launch deployed site
