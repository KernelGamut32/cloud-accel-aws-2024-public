    - Specify a name for the environment
    - Select `Additional instance types` and choose `t3.medium`
    - Leave all other options at their defaults, and click `Create`

    - Select `Storage`, click the `Volume ID` link, click the checkbox next to your volume, and select `Modify volume` from the `Actions` dropdown
    - Increase size from `10` to `30` GiB; click `Modify` and click `Modify` in the confirmation dialog
    - Reboot your EC2 instance
    - Go back to Cloud9, click the radio button next to your Cloud9 environment, and click `Open in Cloud9`

* Follow the steps outlined in the linked tutorial
* Use the steps described in lab 05 to create an SSH key (or reuse the key created as part of a previous lab)
* For `docusaurus.config.js`, use something like `https://<user/org ID>.gitlab.io` for `url` and leave `baseUrl` at `/`
* Once build/deploy steps complete, use `https://<user/org ID>.gitlab.io/<project name>` to launch deployed site
