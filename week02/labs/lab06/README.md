# Lab 06 - [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/tutorial.html)

* Execute in a Cloud9 environment in an ACG sandbox host - **you will likely need to use a larger environment than the default for this lab**
* Follow the steps outlined in the linked tutorial
* Use the steps described in lab 05 to create an SSH key (or reuse the key created as part of a previous lab)
* For `docusaurus.config.js`, use something like `https://<user/org ID>.gitlab.io` for `url` and leave `baseUrl` at `/`
* Once build/deploy steps complete, use `https://<user/org ID>.gitlab.io/<project name>` to launch deployed site
